title: Minimax Online Prediction of Varying Bernoulli Process under Variational Approximation
crossref: acml19
abstract: We consider the online prediction of a varying Bernoulli process 
  (sequence of varying Bernoulli probabilities) from a single binary sequence.
  A real-valued online prediction method has been proposed as a prior work that 
  incorporates the smoothness of the prediction sequence into the concept of the 
  regret. Also, a Bayesian prediction method for the varying Bernoulli processes 
  has been developed based on the variational inference. However, the former is not 
  applicable to loss functions other than the  squared error function, and the latter 
  has no guarantee on the regret as an online prediction method.
  We propose a new online prediction method of a varying Bernoulli process from a single 
  binary sequence with a guarantee to minimize the maximum regret under variational approximation.
  Through numerical experiments, we compare the Bayesian prediction method with the 
  proposed method by using the regret with/without approximation and the KL divergence 
  from the true underlying process.
  We discuss the prediction accuracy and influences of the approximation of the proposed method.
