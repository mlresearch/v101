title: Learning to Augment with Feature Side-information
crossref: acml19
abstract: >
    Neural networks typically need huge amounts of data to train in
    order to get reasonable generalizable results. A common approach
    is to artificially generate samples by using prior knowledge of
    the data properties or other relevant domain knowledge. However,
    if the assumptions on the data properties are not accurate or the
    domain knowledge is irrelevant to the task at hand, one may end up
    degenerating learning performance by using such augmented data in
    comparison to simply training on the limited available dataset. We
    propose a critical data augmentation method using feature
    side-information, which is obtained from domain knowledge and
    provides detailed information about features' intrinsic
    properties. Most importantly, we introduce an instance wise
    quality checking procedure on the augmented data. It filters out
    irrelevant or harmful augmented data prior to entering the
    model. We validated this approach on both synthetic and real-world
    datasets, specifically in a scenario where the data augmentation
    is done based on a task independent, unreliable source of
    information. The experiments show that the introduced critical
    data augmentation scheme helps avoid performance degeneration
    resulting from incorporating wrong augmented data.
